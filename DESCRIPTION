Description: Vignettes and resources to support a 90 minute
    tutorial. Modern methods of high-throughput genomic data generate
    large primary data sets that require significant data manipulation
    and statistical summary before arriving at biological
    insight. This workshop starts by outlining basic DNA sequence
    analysis work flows, from primary data generation to biological
    interpretation. We use this outline, and especially the 'RNA-seq
    known gene differential expression' work flow, to identify
    relevant data management and statistical issues. The workshop then
    steps through _R_ and _Bioconductor_ code to implement essential
    stages in data management and statistical analysis. We conclude
    with a brief overview of the resources available for further
    study.
